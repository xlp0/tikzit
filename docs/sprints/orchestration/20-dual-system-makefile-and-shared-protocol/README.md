# Sprint 20: Dual-System Makefile & Shared Protocol Specification
**Directory:** `docs/sprints/orchestration/20-dual-system-makefile-and-shared-protocol`  
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Graduated)  
**Date:** 2026-09-29  

## Executive Summary
Created an authored, human-readable root `Makefile` replacing the auto-generated 3,553-line qmake artifact. Established a unified developer interface supporting `make test-web`, `make check-independence`, `make check-conformance`, `make build`, and `make lint`. Authored an automated 5-check browser independence gate (`scripts/verify-browser-independence.mjs`) ensuring zero native C++ or `node-gyp` bindings leak into the browser runtime, and published the formal Shared Dual-System Protocol Specification (`docs/architecture/SHARED-PROTOCOL-SPECIFICATION.md`). Under Decision Record D19, the native C++ implementation remains untouched in its original state as an immutable reference baseline.

## Verification & Test Results
* **Browser Runtime Independence:** `scripts/verify-browser-independence.mjs` — 5/5 checks passed (package.json dependencies, build scripts, source tree imports, dist bundles, WASM sqlite).
* **Protocol & Math Suite:** `tests/unit/protocol/sharedProtocol.test.ts` — 16 unit tests passing (T20-01 to T20-16).
* **Makefile Integration:** `tests/unit/build/makefile.test.ts` — target execution and shadow build isolation passing.
* **Corpus Verification:** 12/12 canonical ZX diagrams passing (`make verify-corpus`).
